## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“š Currently a Software Development Student at Dundee & Angus College             
âš¡ Outside of college I enjoy creating websites and exploring Web Development, whilst learning new ways to use HTML, CSS, and PHP        

ðŸŽ§ Also, somewhat of a Daft Punk fanatic!     

Currently i am working on continual improvements on recently finished projects whilst researching into learning:     
- C++
- Typescript
