## Hi there 👋
📚 Software Development Student @ Abertay University in BSc (Hons) Computing!    
⚡ In my free time, I enjoy creating websites and exploring Web Development, whilst learning new ways to use HTML, CSS, PHP & SQL.    

###### 🎧 Also, somewhat of a Daft Punk fanatic!     

Currently i am focused on continuous improvements to recently completed projects: 
- **SheetLess, A Digital Traveller Solution**
          
Whilst also dedicating time to research and learn:     
- **C++**
- **Typescript**
