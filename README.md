## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“š Software Development Student @ Abertay University in BSc (Hons) Computing!    
âš¡ In my free time, I enjoy creating websites and exploring Web Development, whilst learning new ways to use HTML, CSS, PHP & SQL.    

###### ðŸŽ§ Also, somewhat of a Daft Punk fanatic!     

Currently i am focused on continuous improvements to recently completed projects whilst also spending time on: 
- Not working on any active projects.
          
Also dedicating time to research:    
- **React**
- **Supabase**
