## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“š Software Development Student at Dundee & Angus College & Abertay University             
âš¡ Outside of college I enjoy creating websites and exploring Web Development, whilst learning new ways to use HTML, CSS, and PHP        

###### ðŸŽ§ Also, somewhat of a Daft Punk fanatic!     

Currently i am focused on continuous improvements to recently completed projects whilst also dedicating time to research and learn:     
- **C++**
- **Typescript**
